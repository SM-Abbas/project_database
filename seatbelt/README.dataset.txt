Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Road Safety Surveillance: The "Seat-Belt Detection" model could be used in advanced traffic control systems to identify drivers or passengers not wearing seat belts, thereby enhancing road safety measures and helping in punishing violations.

2. Automotive Industry Testing: Car manufacturers could use the model during vehicle tests to validate and verify the functionality of the seat belt alert systems in different models of cars. 

3. Insurance Claim Verification: The model could be used by insurance companies to validate claims related to road accidents, particularly when there are disputes around whether seat belts were used or not at the time of the accident.

4. Safe Driving Apps: Developers can integrate this model into safe driving applications that alert drivers or passengers when they have not buckled up, promoting safe driving habits.

5. School Bus Management: The model could be used in school buses to ensure that all students are wearing their seat belts before the vehicle starts moving, enhancing child safety on school bus rides.
